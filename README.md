//-------|  CURRENT STATUS: on hold while dealing with classes for a few weeks

//-------|  Basic:     complete(V1, still needs work but it is usable)(last major update: 10/25/2017 ~8:15PM)

//-------|  Networked: Incomplete

//-------|  Advanced:  Incomplete


Currently the "basic" branch will contain the program
Basic will contain the program at it's minimal planned function setup of creating, editing, saving, and loading user, and randomly generated maps
Networked is a version I plan to use to learn about network programming, with the goal of a DM being able to push the current map to clients on a LAN network
Advanced is the never complete version, it will be the version that will continue to recieve changes and additions once the other two are finished

This will be updated as progress is made, and as i remember
